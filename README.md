A simple yet powerful AI assistant you can run right in your terminal!

---

<h3>▶️ Run It</h3>

```bash
python3 feai.py
```

Make sure Python is installed on your system. If not, install it first.

---

<h3>🔐 API Key</h3>

1. Open the `feai.py` file with any text editor.  
2. Add your API key.  
   ➤ Get one from [openrouter.ai/settings/keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)

<h3>🎯 Personalization</h3>

Want to customize your AI assistant?

- Go to *line 12* and set your assistant's role in the `content` field.
- Also update the same prompt at *line 110* to stay consistent.

---

<h3>💻 Basic Commands</h3>

- `help` → Show help menu  
- `exit` → Quit the assistant  
- `new_` → Start a new session

---

<h3>🛠️ Coming Soon</h3>

FeAi is just the beginning. The goal is to evolve it into a powerful CLI assistant (like Gemini CLI) to support developers with real project tasks, not just basic interactions.

No donations needed — just knowing it's useful is enough 😊
